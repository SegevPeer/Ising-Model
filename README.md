# Ising-Model
By using Monte-Carlo algorithms such as the Demon and Metropolis algorithms I calculated the minimum energy of an Ising model in two and three dimensions. 

I made this project as part of an advanced MATLAB course in materials science.

Some of the main functions I wrote include:

Cal_energy - Calculates the energy of a system based on Ising model.
Change_energy - Calculates the expected change in energy from fliping te spin of a particle.
Mtr - The Metropolis algorithm.
Dem - The Demon algorithm.


I recived very similar results to the results available in literature.
